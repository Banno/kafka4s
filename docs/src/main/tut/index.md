# kafka4s - Functional programming with Kafka and Scala

## Quick Start

To use kafka4s in an existing SBT project with Scala 2.12 or a later version, add the following dependencies to your
`build.sbt` depending on your needs:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.banno" %% "kafka4s" % "<version>"
)
```

## Learning more

To learn more about kafka4s, start with our [Getting Started Guide](/kafka4s/docs/), play with some [example apps](https://github.com/Banno/kafka4s/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala), and check out the [kafka4s Scaladoc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.banno/kafka4s_2.12) for more info.
