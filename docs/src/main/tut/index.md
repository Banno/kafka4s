# kafka4s - Functional programming with Kafka and Scala

## Quick Start

To use kafka4s in an existing SBT project with Scala 2.12 or a later version, add the following dependencies to your
`build.sbt` depending on your needs:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.banno" %% "kafka4s" % "<version>"
)
```
